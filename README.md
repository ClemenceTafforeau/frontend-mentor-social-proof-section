## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I need to focus on using CSS Grid more but I am slowly getting the hang of it.

### Useful resources

- [Yoksel's URL encoder for SVGs](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/) - Does what it says on the tin. Very useful!
